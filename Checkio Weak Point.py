While traveling, the spaceship endures quite a lot of stress. As a result, 
an important part of the maintenance is to check the outer hull. Stephan 
uses a digital durabilitimeter for this task. The device scans a portion of 
the spaceships hull and gives a durability map that is divided by small 
square fragments with measurements. Sometimes Stephan does not have much 
time and he can patch only couple points, so we need an algorithm to find 
the weak points.

The durability map is represented as a matrix with digits. Each number is 
the durability measurement for the cell. To find the weakest point we should 
find the weakest row and column. The weakest point is placed in the intersection 
of these rows and columns. Row (column) durability is a sum of cell durability 
in that row (column). You should find coordinates of the weakest point 
(row and column). The first row (column) is 0th row (column). If a section has 
several equal weak points, then choose the top left point.

Input: A durability map as a list of lists with integers.

Output: The coordinates of the weak point as a list (tuple) of integers.

Example:

weak_point([[7, 2, 7, 2, 8],
            [2, 9, 4, 1, 7],
            [3, 8, 6, 2, 4],
            [2, 5, 2, 9, 1],
            [6, 6, 5, 4, 5]]) == [3, 3]
weak_point([[7, 2, 4, 2, 8],
            [2, 8, 1, 1, 7],
            [3, 8, 6, 2, 4],
            [2, 5, 2, 9, 1],
            [6, 6, 5, 4, 5]]) == [1, 2]
