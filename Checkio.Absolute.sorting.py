"""
Let's try some sorting. Here is an array with the specific rules.
The array (a tuple) has various numbers. You should sort it, but 
sort it by absolute value in ascending order. For example, the 
sequence (-20, -5, 10, 15) will be sorted like so: (-5, 10, 15, -20). 
Your function should return the sorted list or tuple.

Precondition: The numbers in the array are unique by their absolute 
values.

Input: An array of numbers , a tuple..

Output: The list or tuple (but not a generator) sorted by absolute 
values in ascending order.

Addition: The results of your function will be shown as a list in 
the tests explanation panel.

Example:

checkio((-20, -5, 10, 15)) == [-5, 10, 15, -20] # or (-5, 10, 15, -20)
checkio((1, 2, 3, 0)) == [0, 1, 2, 3]
checkio((-1, -2, -3, 0)) == [0, -1, -2, -3]
